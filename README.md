## Installation

minima-theme can be installed with `opam`:

    opam install minima-theme

If you don't use `opam` consult the [`opam`](opam) file for build
instructions.

## Documentation

The documentation and API reference is automatically generated by
`ocamldoc` from the interfaces. It can be consulted [online][doc]
and there is a generated version in the `doc` directory of the
distribution.

## Templates

the directory `opam config var minima-theme:share`.  This is looked up
by default if no base directory is provided when `Minima_theme.v` is called.
